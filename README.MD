# Spotify Clone Web Application

This project is a web application that emulates some of the core functionalities of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. It is built using the Spring Boot framework for the backend and Thymeleaf with Bootstrap for the frontend. Users can register, upload their own music, create albums, manage playlists, and listen to music through a web-based player.

## data and users ##
*  we provided an sql file containing some data:
*  sql file path - src/main/java/com.example.spotifyclone/data/ex4.sql
*  in this database there are 2 users registered- 
*  username - itay password 123456
*  username - yosi password 123456
*  those users share a playlist.
*  we also uploaded a package called - uploades ,in this package we save the actual mp3 files ( in the datat base we save only the paths ).
*  if you want to start from scratch ( meaning uploading your own mp3 files) you can just delete this package.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* JDK 23 or later
* Apache Maven
* MySQL Server

### 1. Database Configuration
1.  Ensure your MySQL server is running.
2.  Create a new database for the project. The default name in the configuration is `ex4`. You can create it with the following SQL command:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE ex4;
    ```
3.  Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
4.  Update the database URL, username, and password to match your local MySQL setup:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ex4?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    ```

### 2. Build and Run the Application
1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
2.  Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
4.  The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## SQL File Information

**No `.sql` file is required for import.**

The project is configured with `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` in the `application.properties` file. This means that Hibernate will automatically create and update the database schema based on the entity classes (`@Entity`) defined in the project. When you run the application for the first time, all necessary tables will be generated in the configured database.

---

## Credentials

There is no default admin or user account. You can create a new user account by navigating to the registration page:

* **URL:** `http://localhost:8080/register`

Simply fill out the registration form to create an account and start using the application.

---

## Known Bugs and Limitations

* **Favorites button color** The color of the favorites button goes back to not being red after reloading the page even
                            though the song is still favorited.
* **Album deletion** Albums can be deleted by other users who did not upload it.
